Text: {text}

Please analyze for:
1. Overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)
2. Energy level (high, medium, low)
3. Stress level (high, medium, low)
4. Executive function indicators (struggling, managing, thriving)
5. Key emotions expressed or implied
6. Potential sensory overwhelm signals (present/not present)
7. Communication style indicators

For neurodivergent individuals, consider that:
- Flat or brief responses might not indicate disinterest
- Intense focus on details could indicate passion rather than anxiety
- Direct communication isn't rudeness
- Variable punctuation/capitalization may express emotion rather than carelessness
